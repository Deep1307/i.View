</div>
<br>


An aptitude test is simply a method of assessment which helps determine the extent of one's potential and/or ability in terms of finishing tasks with little or no prior knowledge/training. Aptitude tests are often used as a tool in pre-employment assessment and can also be used in schools.
<br>

Employers may use this method to identify the best suited persons for certain tasks in order to hire them. Aptitude tests can be held online, in written, or as an additional section in interviews and such.
<br>
Aptitude tests may seem challenging at first due to the short time frames given to finish them, including concepts that can, at times, seem foreign to some. On the good side, however, it can help improve performance levels by practicing certain thumb rules and tips which can in turn make these tests seem more like healthy challenges for the brain.
<br>

This aptitude test consits of 10 questions which are going to test your mathematical skills and
programming skills.
<br>

There are several ways to find out the final answer to a problem. Kepping that in mind,
we have given you the liberty to use any programming language or compiler you want.
